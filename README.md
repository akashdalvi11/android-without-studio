Sample android project to understand how gradle and android sdk work together.
Created this repository for tutorial on how to make apps with just sdk and gradle.
Contains resources to generate a simple app with just a textbox saying 'whatever'.
download all these files and extract them in any folder.
run command "gradle installDebug" to get this app in your android phone. 
(USB debugging must enabled.)
